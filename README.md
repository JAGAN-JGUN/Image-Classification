# Image Classification - Model Training

This repository contains the training pipeline for a **Intel Image classification** system using deep learning. It includes implementations in **both TensorFlow and PyTorch**, focusing on classifying images into categories such as buildings, forest, mountains etc.

---

## Intel Image Classification Dataset

This dataset used here is provided by **Intel** and is designed for natural scene classification. It contains RGB images across 6 natural categories:

* **Buildings**

* **Forest**

* **Glacier**

* **Mountain**

* **Sea**

* **Street**

---

## Objective

To build and compare robust CNN models using TensorFlow and PyTorch for classification using image data. This forms part of a portfolio-ready end-to-end ML project including model training, evaluation, and web deployment.

---

## Components

### TensorFlow Training

* Data Augmentation: `RandomFlip`, `RandomZoom`, `RandomRotation`, etc.
* CNN Layers + BatchNorm + Dropout
* `GlobalAveragePooling2D` + Dense layers
* Regularization with `L1L2`
* `EarlyStopping` and `ModelCheckpoint` callbacks

### PyTorch Training

* CNN architecture with similar depth and regularization
* `AdaptiveAvgPool2d` instead of GAP
* `Dropout` and `BatchNorm` used
* Best model saved using `torch.save`

## How to Train

### TensorFlow

```bash
python TFTrain.py
python TFTest.py
```

### PyTorch

```bash
python TorchTrain.py
python TorchTest.py
```

Make sure your dataset is placed in the `Data/` directory with subfolders:

```
Data/
├── train/
├── val/
└── test/
```
* Note: If the Data doesn't have Validation or Test Data Sets, you can divide training Data Set using **Split.py** uploaded within **Data** folder. Rename the corresponding datasets in the code. 

#### Example:
```bash
cd Data
python Split.py ./path # Replace the ./path with your training dataset. Note that you shouldn't name the path as train, val or test to run the code.
cd ..
```
---

## Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* TensorFlow
* PyTorch
* matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

GPU acceleration is recommended if available.

---

## Highlights

* Dual framework training (TF + Torch)
* Data augmentation and regularization
* Clean modular design for reproducibility
* Evaluation visualizations for clarity
* Ready for deployment in Flask app

---

## 🌐 Deployment

The trained models from this repository are integrated into a **Flask-based Image Prediction API**, allowing you to interact with the models via a simple web interface or programmatically.

You can try out the deployed models here:

👉 [Image Prediction API Repository](https://github.com/JAGAN-JGUN/Image-Prediction-API)

The API supports both **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** models and provides:

- A web interface for image upload & prediction
- REST API endpoint for programmatic access
- Sample usage with unseen images for real-world testing
